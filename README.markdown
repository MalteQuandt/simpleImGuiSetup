This project is meant to provide a simple to use entry point for programmers that want 
to use the DearImGui Library but have trouble with installing the necessary prerequisist.

What you need to have: 
1. Installed a python version (Make sure that it is reachable in the console!)
2. Have CMake installed

Nothing else is really required!
